      "Here are three famous physicists and their key contributions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Sir Isaac Newton**\n",
      "    *   **Key Contributions:**\n",
      "        *   **Laws of Motion:** Formulated the three fundamental laws governing motion (inertia, F=ma, action-reaction) which laid the foundation for classical mechanics.\n",
      "        *   **Universal Gravitation:** Developed the law of universal gravitation, explaining the force that attracts any two objects with mass, from an apple falling to the Earth to the orbits of planets.\n",
      "        *   **Calculus:** Independently developed integral and differential calculus, a crucial mathematical tool for understanding physical change.\n",
      "        *   **Optics:** Made significant contributions to the study of light, demonstrating that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Albert Einstein**\n",
      "    *   **Key Contributions:**\n",
      "        *   **Theories of Relativity:** Developed the Special Theory of Relativity (1905), which redefined space and time, introducing concepts like time dilation and length contraction, and the famous mass-energy equivalence formula, E=mc². He later developed the General Theory of Relativity (1915), which redefined gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.\n",
      "        *   **Photoelectric Effect:** Explained the photoelectric effect (1905), where light causes electrons to be ejected from a material, by proposing that light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons. This was a crucial step in the development of quantum mechanics and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n",
      "        *   **Brownian Motion:** Provided a theoretical explanation for Brownian motion (1905), the random movement of particles in a fluid, which helped to confirm the existence of atoms and molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Marie Skłodowska Curie**\n",
      "    *   **Key Contributions:**\n",
      "        *   **Radioactivity:** Pioneered research into radioactivity, a term she coined. Her work provided the foundational understanding of radioactive decay.\n",
      "        *   **Discovery of New Elements:** Discovered two new radioactive elements, polonium and radium, with her husband Pierre Curie.\n",
      "        *   **Isolation of Radium:** Successfully isolated pure radium metal, proving its existence and allowing for further study of its properties.\n",
      "        *   **Medical Applications:** Advocated for the use of radium for treating cancer and, during World War I, developed mobile X-ray units (\"Petites Curies\") for diagnosing injuries on the battlefield. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields (Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911), and the only person to win Nobel Prizes in multiple sciences.\n",
